# Machine Learning Basics

**Normal Distribution**: A normal distribution is a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where data cluster around the mean.

Itâ€™s important in data analysis and machine learning because many statistical methods assume normality and real-world data often approximate this pattern, especially through the Central Limit Theorem.

**Linear Regression**: a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent varaibles.

**Overfitting**: occurs when a model is too complex and performs too well.
